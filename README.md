## ◼ The Zero-Trace Protocol (Read First)

**Quorix is the world's first decentralized meeting environment designed to operate without client-side JavaScript execution.**

In an era of ubiquitous digital surveillance, standard web-based meeting platforms fingerprint your device, track your IP, and leak metadata through complex script execution. Quorix eliminates this vector entirely.

By running locally as a raw HTML/CSS extension, **we strip away the browser's ability to fingerprint your machine.**

*   **🚫 No Remote Scripts:** We do not load external libraries.
*   **🚫 No Fingerprinting:** Your browser canvas, audio context, and battery status cannot be polled.
*   **🚫 Total Anonymity:** Maximum security for board-level trade secrets.

## ◼ Introduction

**Quorix** is a high-fidelity, open-source video conferencing infrastructure built exclusively for critical business operations. While other platforms cater to casual chats, Quorix is engineered for high-stakes environments: board meetings, M&A discussions, and executive strategy.

We have removed the friction and the surveillance. Just pure, encrypted communication accessible instantly.
