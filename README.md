## ◼ Introduction

**Quorix** is a high-fidelity, open-source video conferencing infrastructure built exclusively for critical business operations. While other platforms cater to casual chats and social gatherings, Quorix is engineered for high-stakes environments: board meetings, merger & acquisition discussions, and executive strategy sessions.

We have removed the friction. **No installations. No downloads. No updates.** Just pure, encrypted, browser-based communication accessible instantly from any device.

## ◼ The Philosophy

When billions are on the line, you don't use consumer-grade software. Quorix is designed with a singular focus on **reliability, infinite scale, and professional conduct**.

*   **Zero-Install:** Runs natively in Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.
*   **Zero-Latency:** Optimized for instant response during critical negotiations.
*   **Business First:** No emojis, no filters, no distractions. Just tools for execution.
